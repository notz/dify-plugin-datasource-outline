# Outline Datasource Plugin Development Guide

## Overview

This plugin provides integration between Dify and Outline, allowing users to import documents and collections from their Outline workspace.

## Architecture

The plugin follows the standard Dify datasource plugin structure:

- `provider/` - Provider configuration and authentication
- `datasources/` - Core datasource implementation
- `datasources/utils/` - Utility classes for API interaction

## Key Components

### OutlineClient
Handles all API interactions with Outline using their RPC-style API.

### OutlineExtractor
Processes and formats document content for use in Dify.

### OutlineDataSource
Main datasource implementation that coordinates between client and extractor.

## API Integration

Outline uses an RPC-style API where all endpoints are POST requests to `/api/:method`. Key endpoints used:

- `documents.list` - List available documents
- `documents.info` - Get document details
- `collections.list` - List collections
- `auth.info` - Get user/workspace information

## Development

1. Set up your development environment
2. Get an Outline API key for testing
3. Test against a real Outline workspace
4. Follow Dify plugin development guidelines
